   My name is AQIB ASGHAR. My father name is MUHAMMAD ASGHAR. I am from Kot Addu, District Muzaffargarh. I am 20 years old. My dream is to become an cyber expert because,Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and data from digital attacks, unauthorized access, theft, damage, or disruption. As the world becomes increasingly connected through the internet, cybersecurity plays a vital role in safeguarding sensitive information, maintaining privacy, and ensuring the smooth operation of digital infrastructure.In today's interconnected environment, cybersecurity spans a wide range of measures and practices aimed at protecting individuals, organizations, and governments from various cyber threats. These threats include malware, phishing, ransomware, data breaches, and denial-of-service attacks, among others. Cybersecurity involves multiple layers of defense, such as firewalls, encryption, antivirus software, and access control policies.<br>
<b>Network Security:</b> Protecting networks from intrusions, unauthorized access, and attacks through firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and secure communication protocols.<br>
<b>Application Security:</b> Ensuring that software applications are secure from vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers, such as coding flaws or improper authentication mechanisms.<br>
<b>Information Security:</b> Securing sensitive data both in transit and at rest using encryption and access control mechanisms.<br>
<b>Identity and Access Management (IAM):</b> Managing users' identities and controlling their access to systems, ensuring only authorized users can access specific resources.<br>
<b>Incident Response and Disaster Recovery:</b> Developing plans and strategies for responding to and recovering from cyberattacks or data breaches, minimizing damage, and restoring normal operations.<br>
<b>Cloud Security:</b> Protecting data and applications that are hosted in cloud environments, ensuring that cloud service providers meet the necessary security standards.<br>
<b>End-User Training:</b> Educating users about best practices, such as recognizing phishing attempts and using strong passwords, to reduce the risk of human error contributing to cyber incidents.<br>
